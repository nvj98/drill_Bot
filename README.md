# drill_Bot
There is a robot on an assembly line whose job is to take a plate of different materials (i.e. metal, plastic, wood, etc.) and drill a number of holes in it at specific (x, y) coordinates, or draw a geometric shapes on the plate. These plates are later used for a variety of applications.
As a more complex example, the robot is commanded to draw and drill an electronic circuit board to
show where resistors, capacitors etc. should be soldered.
In the program it uses recursive functions that command this robot to draw
different shapes or drill at different coordinates in a plate.
